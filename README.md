# 🚗 Vehicle Detection & Speed Estimation System.

This project is a computer vision–based system for **real-time vehicle detection, tracking, speed estimation, and vehicle counting** using deep learning and object tracking techniques.  
It is implemented in **Python** using a Jupyter Notebook.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The system detects vehicles from video input, tracks them across frames, estimates their speed based on line-crossing logic, and counts vehicles by class.  
It is suitable for **traffic monitoring, intelligent transportation systems, and academic learning purposes**.

## ✨ Features

- 🚘 **Vehicle Detection**
  - Uses a YOLO-based object detection model
  - Detects common vehicle classes such as:
    - Car
    - Bus
    - Truck
    - Motorcycle

- 🔁 **Multi-Object Tracking**
  - Uses the SORT (Simple Online Realtime Tracking) algorithm
  - Maintains consistent IDs for vehicles across frames

- ⏱️ **Speed Estimation**
  - Speed calculated using **line-crossing time**
  - Two horizontal lines placed at a fixed real-world distance (default: 5 meters)
  - Speed is estimated when a vehicle crosses both lines

- 🔢 **Vehicle Counting**
  - Counts vehicles per class
  - Counts are updated in real time

- 🎥 **Video Processing**
  - Works on prerecorded video input
  - Frame-by-frame processing with visual overlays

📊 Speed Calculation Logic

Two horizontal lines are drawn on the video frame
Known real-world distance between lines (default: 5 meters)

Speed formula used:

Speed = Distance / Time

Speed is displayed in km/h
